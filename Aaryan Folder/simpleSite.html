        <h2>About Aaryan</h2>
        <p>Aaryan was the kind of person who carried the weight of the world on his shoulders, 
            though he never let it show. He had a quiet strength, the kind that made people instinctively trust him, 
            and a presence that was both reassuring and enigmatic. Standing at six feet tall with dark, tousled hair that always seemed a 
            little unruly no matter how hard he tried to tame it, he had an effortless charisma that made people gravitate toward him. He 
            was the type of person who remembered small details about others—your favorite coffee order, the name of your childhood pet, 
            the book you once mentioned in passing that you loved—and he would bring those things up in conversation months later, making 
            you feel genuinely seen. Born and raised in a small town that he had always felt was too confining for his expansive dreams, 
            Aaryan had a restless spirit, an insatiable curiosity that pushed him to explore beyond the limits of what was familiar. 
            He was always looking for something more, something just out of reach, as though the world had whispered secrets to him that 
            he hadnt quite deciphered yet. Despite his outward confidence, he carried a quiet melancholy, a sense of nostalgia for moments 
            he hadnt yet lived, and a yearning for experiences that remained just beyond his grasp. He had a love for late-night conversations 
            under the stars, for the way the world felt softer in the stillness of the early morning, for the scent of old books and the way rain
            sounded against the windowpane when he was lost in thought. He was the kind of person who would help a stranger change a tire on the
            side of the road without hesitation, who would stay up all night with a friend who needed someone to listen, who believed in the importance
            of kindness even when the world made it difficult. Aaryan was incredibly intelligent but never arrogant about it, always eager to learn from others,
            to listen more than he spoke, to see the world from perspectives that weren’t his own. He had an artist’s soul, though he wasn’t quite sure what to do 
            with it—his sketchbooks were filled with unfinished drawings, his notebooks overflowing with half-written poems, his mind a labyrinth of ideas that never 
            seemed to settle into something concrete. He loved music, but not just any music—he had a deep appreciation for lyrics that told a story, for melodies that 
            made you feel something deep in your chest, for songs that transported you to a different time and place. He could spend hours lost in thought, staring out 
            at the ocean or watching the way the city lights flickered in the distance, always searching for meaning in the ordinary. He wasn’t perfect—far from it, in 
            fact. He had a tendency to overthink, to second-guess himself even when he knew he was right, to get lost in his own head and forget to be present in the moment. 
            He could be stubborn when he believed in something strongly, and sometimes he cared too much, which left him vulnerable to disappointment. But he was also the kind 
            of person who made people feel like they mattered, who made life a little more beautiful just by being in it, who reminded you that even in a world that often felt
            chaotic and overwhelming, there were still people who carried kindness like a flame, refusing to let it be extinguished. Aaryan was, in every way, a contradiction—restless 
            yet grounded, logical yet dreamy, confident yet uncertain, strong yet undeniably human.</p>
