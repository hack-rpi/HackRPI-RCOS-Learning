According to mozilla, backgrounds can be layered on top of each other.

-I'm thinking as an example for the footer, it might be possible to
layer several different backgrounds on top of each other.

-Black background for the footer, then a blue/purple/pink sun thing 
from a radial gradient, and then a PNG of the synthwave grid that fades starting transparent and fading out from the sun. 

This can be done with, using help from w3 schools,
(https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/func_radial-gradient.php)


background-image: url(space_background.png),
                  radial-gradient(blue, purple, pink),
                  url(synthgrid.png)

-My issue with this is the images need specific sizings which might look really ugly inline.

Radial gradient can look like something that looks like 
the synthwave sun.

Glowing marble effect. This could be the sun, but I think it should be more purple/pink and I need to fit it in the footer.

Current Issues: 
- I have to actually write the css
- Getting buttons to work in JavaScript to change the footer theme.
  - This might be done with like JavaScript/jQuery toggle 'on' class
