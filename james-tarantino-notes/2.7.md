Thinking about Design:
I think all of my issues stem from the fact that the style direction for the logo being 80s “synthwave” is so dated. There is not much possible variety for working with that kind of design to me, so I’ve spent a while thinking about getting around it.

We as a group are also limited by Canva’s free template items and fonts, so not everything will look as good as possible yet. I myself am also not good at developing in Canva, I’ve only used photoshop.

-The color choice is good in theory because it’s colorblind-friendly with the oranges,blues, and purples, but orange clashes with the synthwave purple-pink-dark-colors that the design is known for. 
	→ So, I think it may be worthwhile to follow the path of a more minimalist design. Just more solid colors over vaporwave neon patterns. Something closer to this, although it is not very creative:

-The current logo feels like it could be worked on more. And the subtitle text is hard to read entire paragraphs of, though that has the right idea. 


I found a font online for free personal use, but it’s not perfected to be the actual logo and I’m not sure how it would work to use under free use (the font name is overglow). I used a simple gradient overlay to make it look more theme-relevant.

I also moved around more of the template items to try and come up with more ideas.
