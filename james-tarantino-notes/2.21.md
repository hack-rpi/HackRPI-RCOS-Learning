Responsive Design*
-It's a good idea to acknowledge mobile users, and
tailwind uses "design breakpoints", which can mark
classes with the mobile screen display versions of 
what it would look like.

Tailwind imports with @tailwind (_(name)_) can edit
designs in different "components" and "layers" for a more detailed design.

Tailwind is based on the ideology that CSS can be done without a bunch of class declarations and can be
made readable.

Tailwind provides cutom utility classes to add.
