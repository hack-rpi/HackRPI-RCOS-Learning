A component in React is not just a function but it's
own purpose. 
The product table read in from the json has different
components:
- The table itself is a component, and encapsulates the entire app.
-Search bar which exists to get input
-Display items list 
-Display header
-Display row

Commponents can be written using other components
in unchanging static sites. Larger projects can be started as single components and combine into a larger one, instead of just coding top-down like normal, which makes React unique.

Hooks "hook" onto components and allow for the website to change. 

To save information between refreshes, you can 
import useState from 'react'; and then be able to 
save information to state variables. useState is a kind of hook.

React uses JSX, which is like HTML markup.
