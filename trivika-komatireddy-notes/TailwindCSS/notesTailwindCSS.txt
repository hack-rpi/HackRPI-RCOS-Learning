BASICS
- CSS framework 
- builds on top of CSS
- efficient 
- easy to customize
- faster than regular CSS
- very similar to CSS, but some syntax differences
- well-documented
- utility classes are used which are easy to maintain and update
- custom CSS does not have to be written
- built into HTML markup
- doesn't have built-in animation tools

CUSTOMIZATION
- theme can be customized to include particular colors and more, for ex.:

colors: {
   "twitter-blue": <hex code>
}

^^ custom names can be used inline

- customization can be used for individual layers (base, components, utilities)
- to add style to HTML elements, use the base layer
- to add style to more complicated classes, use the components layer
- utilities layer can be used for features that Tailwind doesn't have by default
- @apply can be used as a shortcut for writing CSS
