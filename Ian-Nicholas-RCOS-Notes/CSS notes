/* 
CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, 
including the design,
layout and variations in display for different devices 
and screen sizes.

/* This is a comment */
body {
    background-color: lightblue; /* This is an inline comment */

  /*
CSS solved a big problem for HTML
-> HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a webpage

- HTML describes the content of a web page,
When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added
to the HTML 3.2 specification, 
it started a nightmare for web developers. 

Development of large websites, 
where fonts and color information were added to every single page, 
became a long and expensive process.

To solve this problem, 
the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page.
*/

/*CSS style definitions are normally saved in external .css files*/

/*With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!*/

/*
3 ways to add CSS to HTML

Inline:
Quick makeover directly in an HTML tag
body { background-color: powderblue; } h1 { color: blue; } p { color: red }

Internal: 
Dedicated section in HTML file for styles

External:
Seperate file completely dedicated to styles

CSS makes you website 
  - look good
  - improve readability and user experience
  - allow your website to work on multiple devices

/*
The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.

Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.

Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.*/

/*In this example all <p> elements will be center-aligned, with a red text color:*/

p {
  color: red;

/* p is the selector that points to the HTML element you want to style

color is a propery, red is the property value

text-align is a propery, center is the property value*/




/*  ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////    CSS SELECTORS    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////   */

/*CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style

We can dicide CSS selectors into 5 catagories:

    Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)

    Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
    
    Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
    
    Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
    
    Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)


CSS ELEMENT SELECTOR
selects HTML elements based on element name*/

p {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
  }



/*CSS ID SELECTOR
uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element
The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!
To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.

The CSS rule below will be applied to the HTML element with id="para1": */

#para1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

/* An id name CANNOT start with a number 


CSS CLASS SELECTOR
selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.

Example
In this example all HTML elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned: */

.center {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}

/*You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class.

Example
In this example only <p> elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned: */

p.center {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
  }

/*HTML elements can also refer to more than one class.

Example
In this example the <p> element will be styled according to class="center" and to class="large":

<p class="center large">This paragraph refers to two classes.</p>

A class name cannot start with a number



CSS UNIVERSAL SELECTOR
The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.

Example
The CSS rule below will affect every HTML element on the page: */

* {
  text-align: center;
  color: blue;
}

/* CSS GROUPING SELECTOR

grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.

Look at the following CSS code (the h1, h2, and p elements have the same style definitions):*/

h1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

h2 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

/*It will be better to group the selectors, to minimize the code.

To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.

Example
In this example we have grouped the selectors from the code above: */

h1, h2, p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
