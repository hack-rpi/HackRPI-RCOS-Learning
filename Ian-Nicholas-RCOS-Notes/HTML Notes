WHAT IS HTML?

- Hyper Text Markup Language
- standard markup language for creating Web pages
- describes the structure of a Web page
- consists of a series of elements
- elements tell the browser how to display the content
- elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

A Simple HTML Document ^above^ 

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration 
  - defines that this document is an HTML5 document

The <html> element 
    - is the root element of an HTML page

The <head> element
    -  contains meta information about the HTML page

The <title> element 
    - specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)

The <body> element 
    - defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, 
    such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

The <h1> element defines a large heading

The <p> element defines a paragraph



What is an HTML Element?
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>


***
<br>	none	none
Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). 
These elements are called empty elements. 
Empty elements do not have an end tag!
***


Web Browsers
The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) 
is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.

A browser does not display the HTML tags, 
but uses them to determine how to display the document:


HTML Page Structure
Below is a visualization of an HTML page structure:

<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page title</title>
  </head>

  <body>
      <h1>This is a heading</h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
      <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
  </body>

</html>


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////



HTML BASIC EXAMPLES
All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.

The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.

The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.


The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration 
  - represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.

It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is:


HTML Headings
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading: 
-->

<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>

<!--
HTML Paragraphs
HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag:
-->

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

<!--
HTML Links
HTML links are defined with the <a> tag:
-->

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>

<!--
The link's destination is specified in the href attribute. 

Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.

You will learn more about attributes in a later chapter.


HTML Images
HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.

The source file (src), alternative text (alt), 
width, and height are provided as attributes:
-->

<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">

<!--

How to View HTML Source
Have you ever seen a Web page and wondered
 "Hey! How did they do that?"

View HTML Source Code:
Click CTRL + U in an HTML page, o
r right-click on the page and select "View Page Source". 
This will open a new tab containing the HTML source code of the page.

Inspect an HTML Element:
Right-click on an element 
(or a blank area), and choose "Inspect" 
to see what elements are made up of 
(you will see both the HTML and the CSS). 
you can also edit the HTML or CSS on-the-fly in the Elements or Styles panel that opens.



////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


HTML ELEMENTS

The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>


Nested HTML Elements
HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).

All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.

The following example contains four HTML elements (<html>, <body>, <h1> and <p>):
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

<!--
The <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.

It has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html>.

Then, inside the <html> element there is a <body> element:



Empty HTML Elements
HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.

The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:
-->

<p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>

<!--
HTML is NOT Case Sensitive
HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.

The HTML standard does not require 
lowercase tags, 
but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, 
and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.



///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

HTML ATTRIBUTES

All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"


The href Attribute
The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. 
The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:
-->

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>

<!--
The src Attribute
The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. 
The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:
-->

<img src="img_girl.jpg">

<!--
There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

1. Absolute URL - 
  Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. 
  Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".


Notes: External images might be under copyright. 
If you do not get permission to use it, 
you may be in violation of copyright laws.
 In addition, you cannot control external images; 
 it can suddenly be removed or changed.

2. Relative URL 
  Links to an image that is hosted within the website. 

  Here, the URL does not include the domain name.
   If the URL begins without a slash, 
   it will be relative to the current page.
  Example: src="img_girl.jpg". 

    If the URL begins with a slash, 
    it will be relative to the domain. 
  Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".

Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. 
They will not break if you change domain.


The width and height Attributes
The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, 
which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels): -->

<img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">

<!--
The alt Attribute

The required alt attribute for the <img> 
tag specifies an alternate text for an image, 
if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. 
This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, 
or if the user uses a screen reader.

-->

<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">

<!--
If we try to display an image that does not exist, 
the value of the alt attribute will be displayed instead.
-->

<!--
The style Attribute
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, 
such as color, font, size, and more.
-->

<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

<!--

The lang Attribute
You should always include the lang attribute 
inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. 
This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.

The following example specifies English as the language: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<!--

Country codes can also be added to the language code 
in the lang attribute. 
So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page, 
and the last two characters define the country.

The following example specifies 
English as the language and United States as the country:-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">

<!--

The title Attribute
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.

The value of the title attribute will be 
displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:

-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2 title="I'm a header">The title Attribute</h2>

<p title="I'm a tooltip">Mouse over this paragraph, 
  to display the title attribute as a tooltip.</p>

</body>
</html>


<!--

We Suggest: Always Use Lowercase Attributes
The HTML standard does not require lowercase attribute names.

The title attribute (and all other attributes) 
can be written with uppercase or lowercase like title or TITLE.

However, W3C recommends lowercase attributes in HTML, 
and demands lowercase attributes for stricter document types like XHTML.
-->

<!--
Single or Double Quotes?
Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML,
 but single quotes can also be used.

In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, 
it is necessary to use single quotes:
-->

<p title='John "ShotGun" Nelson'>

<!--OR VICE VERSA-->

<p title="John 'ShotGun' Nelson">

HTML HEADINGS
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.-->

  <h1>Heading 1</h1>
  <h2>Heading 2</h2>
  <h3>Heading 3</h3>
  <h4>Heading 4</h4>
  <h5>Heading 5</h5>
  <h6>Heading 6</h6>

<!--
  
Headings Are Important
Search engines use the headings to index 
the structure and content of your web pages.

Users often skim a page by its headings. 
It is important to use headings to show the document structure.

<h1> headings should be used for main headings, 
  followed by <h2> headings, then the less important 
    <h3>, and so on.


Bigger Headings
Each HTML heading has a default size. 
However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, 
using the CSS font-size property:-->

<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>


<!--//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


HTML PARAGRAPHS

HTML Paragraphs
The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.

A paragraph always starts on a new line, 
and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) 
before and after a paragraph.


HTML Display
You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.

Large or small screens, 
and resized windows will create different results.

With HTML, you cannot change the display 
by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.

The browser will automatically remove 
any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed:
-->

  <p>
  This paragraph
  contains a lot of lines
  in the source code,
  but the browser
  ignores it.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  This paragraph
  contains         a lot of spaces
  in the source         code,
  but the        browser
  ignores it.
  </p>
  

<!--

HTML Horizontal Rules
The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, 
and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.

The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) 
in an HTML page:-->

<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr> <!-- acts like a break line inbetween paragraphs-->
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr>


<!--
HTML Line Breaks
The HTML <br> element defines a line break.

Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) 
without starting a new paragraph:
-->

<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>

<!--^^
This is
a paragraph
with line breaks.
-->

<!--

The HTML <pre> Element
The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.

The text inside a <pre> element 
is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), 
and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>The pre tag preserves both spaces and line breaks:</p>

<pre>
   My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

   My Bonnie lies over the sea.

   My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
   
   Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</pre>

</body>
</html>

<!--/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


HTML STYLES & HTML TEXT FORMATTING

<p>I am normal</p>
<p style="color:red;">I am red</p>
<p style="color:blue;">I am blue</p>
<p style="font-size:50px;">I am big</p>

<!--
HTML Style Attribute
Setting the style of an HTML element, can be done with the style attribute.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p><b>This text is bold</b></p>
<p><i>This text is italic</i></p>
<p>This is<sub> subscript</sub> and <sup>superscript</sup></p>

<b> - Bold text
<strong> - Important text
very similar


<i> - Italic text
<em> - Emphasized text\
very similar

<mark> - Marked text (highlighted)
<small> - Smaller text
<del> - Deleted text (strikethrough)

HTML QUOTATION AND CITATION ELEMENTS

HTML <blockquote> for Quotations
The HTML <blockquote> element defines a section 
that is quoted from another source.

Browsers usually indent <blockquote> elements.-->

  <p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>
  <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_them_eat_cake.html">
    "Let them eat cake" is the traditional translation of the French phrase 
    "Qu'ils mangent de la brioche",[1] 
    said to have been spoken in the 18th century by "a great princess" 
    upon being told that the peasants had no bread.  
  </blockquote>

<!--
  
HTML <q> for Short Quotations
The HTML <q> tag defines a short quotation.

Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.-->

<p>WWF's goal is to: <q>Build a future where people live in harmony with nature.</q></p>

<!--

HTML <abbr> for Abbreviations
The HTML <abbr> tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, 
like "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM".

Marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, 
translation systems and search-engines.

Tip: Use the global title attribute to show the 
description for the abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over the element. -->

<p>The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> was founded in 1948.</p>

<!--

HTML <address> for Contact Information
The HTML <address> tag defines the contact information 
for the author/owner of a document or an article.

The contact information can be an email address, 
URL, physical address, phone number, social media handle, etc.

The text in the <address> element usually renders in italic, 
and browsers will always add a line break before and after the <address> element.-->

<address>
  Written by John Doe.<br>
  Visit us at:<br>
  Example.com<br>
  Box 564, Disneyland<br>
  USA
  </address>

<!--
HTML <cite> for Work Title
The HTML <cite> tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc.).

Note: A person's name is not the title of a work.

The text in the <cite> element usually renders in italic.-->

  <p>The HTML cite element defines the title of a work.</p>
